# Write content, not code!

## Introduction

### What is this?

This is a Next.js app that automatically converts hierarchy of Markdown files into static website.

### Why would you need to build that?

Well, few reasons actually:

- I'm a software engineer
- I'm a lazy software engineer
- I love to publish random, minimalistic and elegant websites with information about something
- I'm considering to add some killer features that will work for my laziness
